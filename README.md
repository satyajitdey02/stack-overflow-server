# stack-overflow-server
Stack overflow mock API server

Run the following command to run json-server:
$json-server --watch stackoverflow.json

For now we can use a single json file to mock Stack overflow DB. 
The structure of the initial JSON file is as stackoverflow.json.

We can change the necessary file structures and cofigs based on requirements.
