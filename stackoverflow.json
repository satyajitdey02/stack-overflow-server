      "body": "I have an img element, on click I want it to transform into an iframe (embedded video). I have assigned a ref to the element and also, I attach an event listener to the element when the component mounts. \nThe problem I am experiencing is that I am not seeing the changes I expect. I am getting an error Cannot read property addEventListener of null in the console. On clicking the image nothing happens, I assume either the event listener is not attached or the handler method is not working properly. What am i doing wrong here?",

You can add a state variable to ViewCourse, something like showIframe, and pass it down to ViewOneCourse, then inside ViewOneCourse you would use that variable (showIframe) to render either the image or the iframe.",
